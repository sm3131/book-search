## Description

This book search application was created to allow users to create an account, search for books, and save them to their online book library. This book search engine provides a vast variety of books that should match your interests. You can easily sign-up to create an account and get started. Also if you are unsure about creating an account, you can initially browse the search engine to see how it functions before you commit to an account. Without an account you will not be able to save books to your online library. Once you add a book to your online library, you have the ability to remove the book if you have already read it or are no longer interested in a specific book. Have fun searching and reading books all year long.

## Credits

Initial starter code was provided by [Xandromus](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli) for this project. The starter code included a fully functional book search engine application, but it used a RESTful API, and the purpose of this project was to convert this API to a GraphQL API. So all of the code on both the front-end and back-end that used GraphQL was written and created by myself, Sammi Moore. 

The resources that I used for this project are as follows:
- The mongoose package from npm in this node.js application in order more easily use mysql databases (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
- The express package from npm to create the server and routes (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- https://opensource.org/licenses/ (To borrow the license section text describing the terms of each of the licenses included in the readme generator)
- https://shields.io/ (To generate the link to create the license badge)
For the license badges and license section of the readme, I used the following resources:
- https://choosealicense.com/ (To help with picking which licenses to include)
- https://shields.io/ (To generate the link to create the license badge)
- https://wisehackermonkey.github.io/badge-demo/ (To help with coloring the license badges and grabbing the license links)
- https://opensource.org/licenses/ (To borrow the license section text describing the terms of each of the licenses included in the readme generator)
